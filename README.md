# Prime Factorization

- Create a program called `PrimeFactorization.java`
- Create a recursive static method that takes an integer greater than or equal to 2 and returns a String containing all the prime factors of that integer in non-decreasing order separated by spaces
  - Do NOT include the number 1 in the prime factors of a number
- In the main method:
  - Prompt the user for an integer
  - Call the prime factorization method with that integer as a parameter
  - Print the result

Example Input: <br/>
36
<br/>
Example Output: <br/>
2 2 3 3
